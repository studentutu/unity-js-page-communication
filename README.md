This repository contain example how you can implement communication between Unity WebGL and a page. You can check how it was created!

In addition to this repository I also made a post about it that you can find here: https://www.patrykgalach.com/2020/05/04/communication-between-unity-webgl-and-page/

# How to use it?

Clone this repository to you computer or browse it online!

If you want to see that implementation, go straight to [Assets/Scripts/](https://bitbucket.org/gaello/unity-page-communication/src/master/Assets/Scripts/) folder. You will find all code that I wrote to make it work. Code also have comments so it would make a little bit more sense.

I hope you will enjoy it!
